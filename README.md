# BIMCamel — fast Navisworks → IFC exporter

A free, open-source **Autodesk Navisworks** plug-in that exports models to **IFC** (IFC4 and IFC2x3),
built for **speed, small files, and zero-config first-click export**. Navisworks has no native IFC
export — BIMCamel fills that gap without the slowness and setup friction of the commercial tools.

## Highlights

- **Streaming, memory-bounded engine.** Exports huge models without the out-of-memory crashes that
  plague naïve exporters — peak memory stays bounded (a few hundred MB) regardless of model size.
- **Geometry instancing.** Repeated parts (bolts, fittings…) are written once as
  `IfcRepresentationMap` + `IfcMappedItem`, so files stay small.
- **Dual-schema, every feature in both.** IFC4 (`IfcTriangulatedFaceSet`) and IFC2x3
  (`IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel`), including the generic IFC2x3 MEP vocabulary
  (`IfcFlowSegment`/`IfcFlowController`/…).
- **Friction-free by default.** First click produces a valid, correctly-placed IFC with no setup.

## Features

- **Geometry** — tessellated meshes via the COM geometry path; vertex welding; quality presets
  (Small file / Balanced / High detail) with coordinate precision tied to the weld tolerance.
- **Scope** — whole model, current selection, active section box, a saved/search set, or
  **batch: multiple sets → one IFC each**.
- **Size splitting** — cap output size (e.g. 200 MB); larger exports roll into `name_001.ifc`,
  `name_002.ifc`, … each a complete, standalone IFC. Composes with batch.
- **Property sets** — category-qualified, typed values, with content **dedup** (identical psets
  shared) and optional parameter renaming/relocation to standard Psets.
- **Object → IFC class mapping** — assign Navisworks sets to IFC classes (with optional
  PredefinedType); unmapped elements stay `IfcBuildingElementProxy`.
- **Type objects, materials, classification, base quantities** (volume / area / length computed
  from the mesh), **multi-storey** spatial structure from a Level property.
- **Coordinates & georeferencing** — base-point modes with live preview; IFC4 `IfcMapConversion`,
  IFC2x3 baked placement. All split parts / batch files share one origin so they overlay.
- **Reporting** — element/triangle counts, file size, a per-entity-type size profile, a phase-timing
  breakdown, and peak memory; export profiles save/load all settings as JSON.
- Pure managed, **no third-party runtime dependency**; ships for Navisworks **2024 / 2025 / 2026**,
  Manage and Simulate.

## Install

Download the latest installers from the **[Releases](../../releases/latest)** page:

| Installer | Needs admin? | Installs for |
|---|---|---|
| **BIMCamel_Setup.exe** | Yes | all users (machine-wide) |
| **BIMCamel_Setup_NoAdmin.exe** | **No** | current user only |

Both let you pick which Navisworks versions (2024/2025/2026) and which flavour (Manage / Simulate)
to enable. Restart Navisworks — a **BIMCamel** ribbon tab appears with **IFC exporter** and **About**
buttons. (The installers are unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on first run.)

**Manual install (no tooling):** copy a built `BIMCamel.bundle` folder into
`%AppData%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\` — Navisworks loads it on next launch.

## Quick start

1. **BIMCamel** ribbon tab → **IFC exporter** to open the panel.
2. Pick a schema and scope (default: IFC4, whole model). Everything else has sensible defaults.
3. Click **Export IFC**, choose a path, done.

> **Slow export?** An active **DataTools / external-database link** runs a query per object and can
> add many minutes (and floods the console with `DATATOOLS_SQL_EXEC` errors if broken). Deactivate
> it under **Home → DataTools** before exporting. The panel shows an up-front reminder.

## Build from source

Requires the .NET SDK and a Navisworks install for the compile-time API references.

```bat
dotnet build BIMCamel\BIMCamel.csproj -c Debug
```

Debug builds auto-deploy to your per-user `BIMCamel.bundle` for quick iteration. To produce the
installers (needs free [Inno Setup 6+](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)):

```powershell
installer\build_installers.ps1
```

The project references the Navisworks API with `Private=False` (no Autodesk DLLs are redistributed);
override the API path per machine with `-p:NavisworksDir="…\Navisworks Manage 2025"`.
